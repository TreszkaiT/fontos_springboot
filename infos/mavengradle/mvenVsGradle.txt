Phases:
===================================================
validate: ensures the Maven project is correct
compile: transforms Java source code into bytecode
test: executes tests to verify application functionality


============================ CLEAN =====================
mvn clean
gradlew clean
- deletes target

============================ COMPILE ============================
mvn compiler:compile
gradlew compileJava
- compiles java classes

mvn compiler:testCompile
gradlew compileTestJava
- compiles java test classes only

============================ BUILD ============================
A Building can (and usually does) involve several steps,
such as pre-processing, compiling, linking, converting
data files, running automated tests, packaging, etc.

package will compile your code and also package it. For
example, if your pom says the project is a jar, it will
create a jar for you when you package it and put it
somewhere in the target directory (by default).

mvn package
gradlew build

============================ INSTALL ============================
install will compile and package, but it will also put
the package in your local repository. This will make
it so other projects can refer to it and grab it from
your local repository.

mvn install
gradlew install
!!! apply plugin: 'maven' !!!!

============================ DEPENDENCY TREE ============================
mvn dependency:tree
gradlew dependencies

============================ DEPLOY ============================
Builds app and deploys to remote repository. needs config.
mvn deploy
gradle publishToMavenLocal

============================= VALIDATE =========================
Validate: This step validates if the project structure
is correct. For example â€“ It checks if all the
dependencies have been downloaded and are available
in the local repository.

mvn validate

============================= TEST =========================
mvn test
gradlew test

============================= SITE =========================
print a site for the project (documentation,
test results etc.)

mvn site:site
gradlew javaDoc
